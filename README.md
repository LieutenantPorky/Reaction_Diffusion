# Reaction Diffusion
Repo to hold the current status of the 3D reaction diffusion simulation project.

## Instructions:

RD_2 is the unity project file - download/clone it, and open it in Unity as a new project. Currently, it instantiates
a voxel grid on the GPU, and simulates the Gray-Scott equations. For each vertex, the R channel is u concentration, G is v concentration.
